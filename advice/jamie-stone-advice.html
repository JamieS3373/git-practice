                <h4>Discomfort Means You are Learning</h4>

                <p>Whenever I am learning something challenging, I feel discomfort or awkward.
                    You might be feeling the same way.
                    This feeling is a good thing&mdash;it means you <em>are</em> learning. Your brain has not figured out how to connect
                    the information yet, so it feels slow. You'll probably start questioning if you will ever get this. Then one day, it'll click, and 
                    the very thing giving you trouble a couple of weeks ago will come quickly. <strong>You have to push through and keep going!</strong>
                </p>
